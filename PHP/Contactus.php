                    <p>Most pastries are best enjoyed on the day of purchase. However, if you need to store them, keep them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them, though this may affect their texture. Bread should be kept in a bread box or wrapped in a paper bag to retain its crustiness.</p>
